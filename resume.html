<h3>Work Experience</h3>

<h4>GaiaGPS</h4>

<p>Although I have worked with GaiaGPS off and on doing contract work in the past several years, since leaving Space Monkey, I have been doing full-time work. Responsibilities include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Built initial iteration of cloud functionality for www.gaiagps.com, www.tryskipper.com, and cloud.hemaexplorer.com.au for sync between multiple devices.</li>
<li>Built web map and printing feature for GaiaCloud, using Leaflet and AngularJS</li>
<li>Built a production environment on coreos/docker in Amazon Web Services, and deployment tools around fleet.</li>
<li>Adhered to 12factor methodology (http://12factor.net/) for application</li>
<li>Added ability to purchase subscriptions through Stripe</li>
<li>Maintained GaiaGPS Android application</li>
</ul>

<h4>Space Monkey</h4>

<p>(Salt Lake City, UT)<br />
  <strong>02/2013 - 01/2014</strong><br />
<em>Senior Software Developer</em></p>

<p>A few coworkers went to start a company, and I wanted to join in. Cofounded with ex-Mozy employees, we set off to take cloud storage out of the traditional "cloud", and into users homes.</p>

<p>Primary responsibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Developed an Android client that communicates with our distributed filesystem</li>
<li>Built a pleasant API for hiding complex DHT and sync logic</li>
<li>Some ops work for provisioning and maintaining servers in EC2, ensuring scalability goals are met</li>
</ul>

<p>Programmed in Python, Java (Android), Go</p>

<h4>Backcountry.com</h4>

<p>(Park City, UT)<br />
   <strong>01/2012 - 02/2013</strong><br />
<em>Senior Software Developer / Team Lead</em></p>

<p>I rejoined Backcountry.com to help with their replatforming project, to take their front-end architecture from Interchange (perl) to ATG (java).  New things done that aren't mentioned below are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use Java in ATG, along with jQuery, Compass.</li>
<li>Took ownership of deployments, responsible for helping the team move from 2 weeks between deployments and manual regressions, to targeted daily deployments with automated regressions.</li>
<li>Helped cut and clarify requirements to meet tight replatforming deadline.</li>
<li>Being an evangelist for Test-Driven Development to the entire engineering department.</li>
<li>Fixing production issues, while also moving the replatforming codebase forward</li>
</ul>

<h4>Beyond Oblivion</h4>

<p>(Salt Lake City, UT)<br />
  <strong>11/2010 - 12/2012</strong><br />
<em>Senior Software Developer</em></p>

<p>Joined Beyond Oblivion because it provided some interesting challenges in that it was a startup so I'd be wearing many hats, the problem space (music) was interesting, scalability was a concern, and the data retrieved could be incredibly interesting.  In the time I was employed, I was able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Implement a unit testing framework adapted specific to Beyond Oblivion's codebase, and trained other engineers on best practices.</li>
<li>Decrease time to develop ingestion scripts from 2 weeks to 2 days, through unit testing and developing a shared framework.</li>
<li>Increase maintainability and turnaround of bugfixes through unit testing.</li>
<li>Increase performance of our "music intelligence" from processing 50 "playcount reports" per second to 300 per second per process.</li>
<li>Eliminated race conditions and deadlocks so multiple processes could run at the same time</li>
<li>Move away from a queue implemented within MongoDB to RabbitMQ, improving throughput of messages.</li>
<li>Develop web UI for maintaining and monitoring "music intelligence" processes, including handling anomaly reporting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Used Python, Django, Twisted, MongoDB, Hadoop, Hive, Mahout, MySQL, among others.</p>

<h4>Backcountry.com</h4>

<p>(Park City, UT)<br />
   <strong>2/2007 - 11/2010</strong><br />
<em>Senior Software Engineer</em></p>

<p>I've been working on Backcountry.com's Community project since its inception, bringing product questions and answers, reviews, gear photos, and user profiles from the minds of visionaries to actual implementation. It consists of a robust, event-driven model providing real-time collaboration to hundreds of thousands of visitors of our website. It was built using perl and the Interchange framework, Rose::DB ORM, memcached, mogilefs, and Moose.  Also took advantage of S3 and EC2.</p>

<p>In addition to doing actual implementation, I have also been responsible for rapidly getting engineers not familiar with the codebase up to speed, given how fast our community is growing.  More recently, I have been on the mobile/labs team, creating a webservice for mobile clients using Java, Jersey, Hibernate, and Spring.</p>

<h4>Notify.me</h4>

<p>(Remote)<br />
  <strong>10/2008 - 1/2010</strong><br />
<em>Lead Developer</em></p>

<p>Moonlighted at notify.me to "deliver time sensitive information directly to the user in near real time", particularly because I was interested in the event-driven architecture and distributed systems.  I worked 10-20 hours per week while employed at Backcountry.com.  Worked on backend features such as improving malformed HTML in websites we consumed, making it more readable for our parser, and various website improvements, including providing a "notification bar" (similar to the Digg bar) on click-thru pages.  Used perl, Catalyst, postgres. </p>

<h4>Mortgage Computer</h4>

<p>(Ogden, UT)<br />
   <strong>03/2006 - 02/2007</strong><br />
<em>Software Developer</em></p>

<p>Developed a web-based loan servicing application for banks and credit unions across the country.  Used Coldfusion, with SQL Server 2000.  Worked on converting a COBOL flat-file based system into a relational, object-oriented model.</p>

<p>Gained experience with Java, Javascript, PHP, and AJAX.</p>
